What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","  - Function is a block of reusable code defined in python file. It can have 0 or more parameters. Python functions can be called by using it's name. Where as methods are functions associated with classes/objects. Methods should always have one parameter which is usually called \"self\". This parameter refer to the object to which the method belongs and this parameter need not to be passed as argument while calling the method. Methods are called using dot(.) operator on object variable.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","  - Parameters are the names defined for the varaibles within the parentheses while defining the function where as, arguments are the actual values that are provided in the paranthesis while calling the function.\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","  - Functions defined using def keyword: These are standard functions defined in python file and can be called using it's name and paranthesis. We can declare 0 or more parameters and the corresponding values should be passed as arguments while calling the function.\n","  - Functions defined using lambda keyword: These are the functions defined  without name unlike functions defined with \"def\" keyword. When ever a function need to be passed as argument to other function like map() function, then these functions can be used. Lamnda function can have any number of arguments but should have only one expression. The result of the expression is implicitly returned.\n","  - Methods: Methods are functions associated with classes/objects. Methods should always have one parameter which is usually called \"self\". This parameter refer to the object to which the method belongs and this parameter need not to be passed as argument while calling the method. Methods are called using dot(.) operator on object variable.\n","  - Nested Functions: These are the functions defined in another function. These functions are defined with \"def\" keyword similar to standard function in the code block of another function. This function can be called only inside the function where it has been defined. The function can also be returned by the function in which it is defined and can be used outside as well.\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n"," - 'return' statment define the value that should be returned after the code block of function is executed once the function is called. The return statement stops the execution of the function and returns the value. If return statement is not defined then it defaults to \"None\".\n","\n"," 5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","  - Iterables are python objects that can be looped over like list, map, set, dictionary, string etc.\n","  - Iterators are the objects that perform the iteration. Iterator object is created by passing the iterable to iter() function. Iterator object is passed to next() function to get the next item of the iterable. If all the items are returned, then next() function will give StopIteration exception.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","  - Generators are iterables that loads the element being returned into memory only when next() function is called. Generators uses \"yield\" keyword instead of \"return\" keyword. Unlike return statement, yield statement pauses the execution at the current state and continues it from there when the next() function is called agian. once the function with yield statements is defined it provides generator object when called and this generator object can be passed to iter() function to get the iterator object this can be passed to next() function to get the values one by one.\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","  - Generators are memory efficient as they load only the element being returned to memory\n","  - Generators can be used for sequences with infinite values\n","  - If there is a large sequence where each element is generated using a large piece of code or from external sytem like data base, if we use regular functions, all the elements need to be loaded before they are iterated where as if we use generator this can be done only when needed. This approach makes generators performance efficient.\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","  - lamda functions defined  without name using \"lambda\" keyword. When ever a function need to be passed as argument to other function like map() function, then these functions can be used. Lamnda function can have any number of arguments but should have only one expression. The result of the expression is implicitly returned.\n","  Syntax: lambda arguments: expression\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n","  - map() function can be used to perform element wise operation on an iterable. map() function takes two argument first argument is the function that is applied on each element to transform it and second argument is the iterable like list, set etc. map() function returns an iterator with the results. This iterator object can be passed to functions like list(), set() etc to get the corresponding objcet with transformed items.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","  - map(): used for element wise transformation. map() function calls the function passed as the first argument on every element and returns an iterable with the transformed elements.\n","  - filter(): used for filtering the elements based on certain criteria. Function passed as first argument boolean value. This function is called  on every element and checks the eligibility. Returns the filtered elements in an new iterable object.\n","  - reduce(): this function should be imported from \"functools\" module. The function being as first argument should have two input arguments and return a single value. The reduce function applies this function cumulatively on the items of iterables from left to right and returns the result as a single value. If there is only one value present in the iterable then it will return this value as is.\n","\n","11.
