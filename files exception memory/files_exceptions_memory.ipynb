{"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMqYxTd8JXB/RAn83IpFRfH"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Files & Exceptional Handling"],"metadata":{"id":"ECKS3u2Y8EJn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?  \n","   - In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. The entire program is converted at once, and the compiled file is directly executable. In interpreted languages like Python, the source code is translated line by line by an interpreter, which reads and executes the program at runtime. This makes interpreted languages more flexible, but typically slower than compiled ones.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?  \n","   - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to manage errors that occur during program execution. Instead of the program crashing, exceptions allow us to gracefully handle errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This helps in maintaining control over the flow of the program even when unexpected errors arise.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?  \n","   - The `finally` block is used to ensure that certain code is executed no matter what, whether an exception was raised or not. It is usually used to perform cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources, ensuring that they occur regardless of the outcome of the try-except block.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?  \n","   - Logging in Python refers to the process of recording runtime events and information, such as errors, warnings, or general information about program execution. It helps in debugging, tracking performance, and understanding the flow of the program. The `logging` module in Python provides flexible logging capabilities.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?  \n","   - The `__del__` method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is often used for cleanup activities, like closing connections or releasing resources. However, it is not guaranteed to be called in all situations, especially when an object’s reference count is not zero at the end of the program.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?  \n","   - The `import` statement is used to bring an entire module into your program, which means you’ll need to reference the module name to access its attributes. `from ... import`, on the other hand, allows you to import specific attributes or functions from a module directly, so you can use them without prefixing the module name.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?  \n","   - Multiple exceptions can be handled using a single `except` block by specifying a tuple of exception types. For example:  \n","     ```python\n","     try:\n","         # Code\n","     except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n","         print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","     ```\n","     Alternatively, you can use multiple `except` blocks to handle each exception separately.\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?  \n","   - The `with` statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file after the block is executed, even if an exception occurs. This prevents resource leaks and ensures that files are properly closed after use. It is often referred to as a context manager.\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?  \n","   - Multithreading involves multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space. It is useful for I/O-bound tasks that don’t require heavy computation. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, involves multiple processes, each with its own memory space, making it better suited for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?  \n","   - Logging allows you to track program execution, monitor performance, and troubleshoot errors. It provides a way to capture detailed information about events that occur during runtime, making it easier to identify bugs, bottlenecks, or performance issues in your code. It also helps in maintaining logs for production environments.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?  \n","   - Memory management in Python refers to how the language allocates and deallocates memory during the program's execution. Python uses an automatic garbage collection mechanism to handle unused objects, which helps in efficient memory usage. The reference counting system and cyclic garbage collection work together to ensure memory is freed when objects are no longer needed.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?  \n","   - The basic steps are:\n","     1. Try: Place the code that might raise an exception inside a `try` block.\n","     2. Except: If an exception occurs, handle it inside the `except` block.\n","     3. Else: Optionally, execute code if no exceptions were raised.\n","     4. Finally: Execute code that should run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?  \n","   - Memory management is crucial in Python to prevent memory leaks and ensure that the program runs efficiently. By using automatic garbage collection and reference counting, Python helps manage memory automatically, reducing the need for developers to manually allocate and free memory, while ensuring that resources are used effectively.\n","\n","14. What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?  \n","   - The `try` block is used to wrap code that might raise an exception. If an exception is raised, Python will immediately jump to the `except` block, where you can handle the exception gracefully, preventing the program from crashing. This helps in managing errors and ensuring that the program can continue running or fail gracefully.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?  \n","   - Python uses a garbage collection system that involves reference counting and cyclic garbage collection. When an object's reference count drops to zero (i.e., no variable is referencing it), the object’s memory is automatically deallocated. Python also looks for circular references using the garbage collector to clean up objects that reference each other but are no longer needed.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?  \n","   - The `else` block in exception handling is used to define code that should execute only if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block. It is useful for placing code that should run after the successful execution of the `try` block but only if there were no errors.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?  \n","   - The common logging levels in Python are:\n","     - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for diagnosing problems.\n","     - `INFO`: General information about the program's progress.\n","     - `WARNING`: A warning about a potential problem.\n","     - `ERROR`: An error that has occurred.\n","     - `CRITICAL`: A critical error that may prevent the program from continuing.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between `os.fork()` and multiprocessing in Python?  \n","   - `os.fork()` is used in Unix-based systems to create a new process by duplicating the current process. The new process has its own memory space. In contrast, `multiprocessing` is a higher-level module in Python that provides a way to create and manage separate processes and supports process-based parallelism across platforms, including Windows.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?  \n","   - Closing a file is important to release the system resources associated with the file. It ensures that any changes made to the file are saved, and the file handle is properly released, preventing memory leaks or issues with accessing the file again.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?  \n","   - `file.read()` reads the entire file content as a single string. On the other hand, `file.readline()` reads one line at a time. If you want to read the file line by line, `readline()` is more memory-efficient.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?  \n","   - The `logging` module is used for logging events, errors, and diagnostic information in Python programs. It provides a flexible framework for recording log messages and allows you to control the log level, format, and output destinations.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?  \n","   - The `os` module in Python provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as manipulating file paths, creating directories, and handling file permissions. In file handling, it is used for operations like checking if a file exists, renaming, or deleting files.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?  \n","   - Some challenges in memory management include managing circular references (which can lead to memory leaks), the overhead of the garbage collection process, and dealing with large datasets that may exhaust available memory. Although Python handles most memory management automatically, developers need to be aware of how objects are stored and referenced.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?  \n","   - You can raise an exception manually using the `raise` keyword followed by the exception type. For example:\n","     ```python\n","     raise ValueError(\"This is a custom error message\")\n","     ```\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?  \n","   - Multithreading is important in applications that need to perform multiple tasks concurrently, such as web servers, real-time data processing, or any application that involves I/O-bound operations. It allows tasks to run in parallel without blocking each other, improving overall performance and responsiveness."],"metadata":{"id":"b0J_sFd27bV_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["How can you
